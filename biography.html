       <p>The self exists without societies, but societies have great influences on how strong or weak an individua's sense of self is. In the feudal societies of the past, the self is oppressed. People's behaviors, lives, marriages, and even hair are related to their families.</p>
       <p class="intropapa">People act in the consideration of the interest of their families, instead of their happiness. Thus, the people's self-consciousness exists, but is weaker than collective consciousness. On the other hand, as societies became more and more open, people now are more focuses on themselves.</p>

       <p>For instance, women are less and less tied down by their families. They have more rights in choosing their husbands, lives, and careers. In addition, society somehow doesn't allow people to only focus on themselves because a harmonious and peaceful society requires people to give up their interests for the sake of others.</p>
